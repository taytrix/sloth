# Project Overview

## Project Name: SLOTH (SL + AUTH)

### Description:
SLOTH is a FastAPI project designed to authenticate Second Life (SL) users for various applications on dix.lol websites. It provides a seamless sign-up and login experience using existing SL credentials and ensures secure authentication through a HUD (Heads-Up Display) in SL.

### Key Features:
1. **Automatic Authorization**: SL users are automatically authorized to use apps on dix.lol websites.
2. **Profile Picture Integration**: SL users' profile pictures are used as their profile pictures on dix.lol websites.
3. **Frictionless Sign-Up/Login**: SL users can sign up and log in using their existing SL credentials.

### Media on Prim:
- Websites can be displayed on a prim's face in SL.
- Any SL user can see the URL on the prim's face with media enabled.
- Media on prim can be attached as a HUD, visible only to the user with the HUD.

### HUD Permissions:
- HUD objects have permissions like COPY, MODIFY, and TRANSFER.
- A secure HUD has no copy, no modify, and no transfer permissions.

### Secure Authentication:
- SL users can navigate to a URL and POST their SL credentials via the HUD.
- The website trusts the SL credentials because the HUD knows a secret for POSTing.
- Only users with permission to own the HUD can register.

### Cookie-Based Authentication:
- FastAPI checks for cookies to identify returning users.
- Cookies are HTTP-Only, persistent (6 months or more), and secure (transmitted over HTTPS).
- Returning users can attach a new SL account to an existing dix.lol account.

### Account Management:
- FastAPI receives POST requests with SL credentials: avatar_key, username, displayname.
- It checks the SQLite database to avoid duplicate accounts with the same SL avatar_key.
- Creates a new user with a new SL account.
- Sets a secure, HTTP-Only, persistent cookie in the browser.
- Displays a success page.

### Traefik Forward Auth:
- SLOTH integrates with Traefik to provide forward authentication.
- Traefik forwards authentication requests to SLOTH.
- SLOTH verifies the user's credentials and returns the appropriate response.
- Ensures that only authenticated users can access protected services.
- Simplifies the authentication process for multiple services behind Traefik.

### Summary:
SLOTH is a FastAPI project that serves as a registration and authentication point within a Traefik network, performing forward authentication for various websites. It continuously checks for cookies to allow users access to services. Registration is exclusively done through a HUD in Second Life, ensuring secure and seamless authentication for SL users. The SLOTH server has two main functions: managing registration and setting cookies, and checking cookies for forward authentication on Traefik.
