This fastapi project is called SLOTH .. Sloth is a combination of SL for Second Life and AUTH for authentication. 

Here's what the project is about through some user stories:

As a SL user, I want to be automatically authorized to use some apps on dix.lol websites
As a SL user, I want to see my SL profile picture as my profile picture on dix.lol websites
As a SL user, I want frictionless sign-up and login using my already existing SL credentials

SL Media on prim is when a website is displayed on a face of a prim
Any SL user can see the URL of the website on the face of a prim that has media enabled on a face
A Media on prim may also be attached as a HUD by a user, and can only be seen by the SL user with the HUD attached
A HUD object has permissions such as COPY, MODIFY, and TRANSER. A HUD with no copy, no modify, and no transfer is secure.
A SL user that attaches a HUD with LSL can be navigated by the HUD to a URL and POST their SL credentials to the URL
The website can TRUST the SL credentials because only the HUD knows a secret which allows it to POST
Anyone registering with the HUD must be someone who had persmission to own the HUD object
The FastAPI first checks if there are any cookies with the request which would indicate a returning user
If it's a returning user then a new SL account is attached to an existing dix.lol account
The FastAPI receives the POST with SL credentials: avatar_key, username, displayname
The FastAPI checks the SQLite database to not make a duplicate account with the same SL avatar_key
The FastAPI creates a new user with a new sl_account
The FastAPI sets a cookie in the browser 
The FastAPI displays a page saying success
